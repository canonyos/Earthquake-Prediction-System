Earthquake Prediction System

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive research project integrating AI, IoT sensors, federated learning, and muon tomography to enhance earthquake prediction and early warning accuracy. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and multi-modal data fusion, this system aims to improve the reliability of seismic forecasting and disaster preparedness.

## Features
- **Real-Time Seismic Data Processing**: Uses IoT-based seismic sensors for continuous monitoring.
- **AI-Powered Predictions**: Implements deep learning models such as LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and Transformers for earthquake forecasting.
- **Federated Learning**: Enables continuous model improvements across distributed sensor nodes while preserving data privacy.
- **Muon Tomography Integration**: Utilizes cosmic-ray muon detection to generate density maps for tectonic stress analysis.
- **Edge-Cloud Hybrid Deployment**: Supports local inference for ultra-low latency and cloud processing for model aggregation.
- **Quantum Computing Exploration**: Investigates potential quantum-enhanced simulations for complex geophysical modeling.
